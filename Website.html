Thank you for all using this site for 2 months unfortunately I will have to shut it down, farewell everyone.

Just kidding! I am migrating our servers to github codespaces instead of github pages this will mean faster load time and fixing all of the broken games thank you guys for playing this migration will be complete very soon.
